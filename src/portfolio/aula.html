        <h3>Creating engaging learning experiences</h3>
        <p>As universities move towards more flexible delivery, creating a learning experience with an engaged learning 
            community has proven critical to student success. However, educators just don't have the time to do it. As a 
            result, universities are limited in their ability to retain and graduate more students every year. Students 
            who feel connected to their learning community are more likely to persist, yet most digital learning platforms 
            create isolated learning experiences. Aula combines easy-to-use technology with evidence-informed learning 
            design to create community-first learning experiences that are as much about meaningful connection as they are 
            about academic challenge.</p>

        <h6 id="challenges-and-goals">My role and the team</h6>
        <h3>Building the foundations of the team</h3>
        <p>When I first joined Aula, in April 2020, I was the only designer in the company. It was my responsibility to 
            bring a focus on the user to the core of our company culture, and to grow and manage the Design team. During 
            my time with Aula, I have led and coordinated all core design initiatives, including establishing user research 
            processes, creating a consistent and accessible design system, improving cross-functional collaboration, hiring 
            and managing the members of the Design team and setting up team rituals and practices.</p>

        </figure>
        <h6 id="challenges-and-goals">Key focus area</h6>
        <h3>Product design</h3>
        <p>I oversaw the design of all of Aula's digital products, such as the web app and the mobile apps, managing the 
            designers on the team and getting involved in hands-on work myself. A key initiative that I led was creating 
            and evolving a design system that brought some much needed consistency to Aula's apps. The design system also 
            helped us be much more efficient when designing and implementing UI, and drastically improved the accessibility 
            of our products, getting us closer to our vision where every learner is empowered to reach their full potential.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Great importance was given to user research at all times. We ran frequent user interviews and used other research
             techniques such as surveys to make sure we were addressing real need and pain points in a way that was simple 
             yet suitable for complex real-world educational scenarios. We also used these learnings to redefine the 
             information architecture of our products, to match our users' mental model and to make sure that we could grow 
             the apps in a scalable way.

        </figure>
        <p>These principles were key to deep redesigns of both our mobile and desktop offerings. Users appreciated how much 
            easier to use the new interfaces are. We also caught the change to fix the accessibility issues and make the 
            visual language more consistent.

        <p>As Aula as a company evolves and as we learn more about our users and the market, so we evolve our product. We are 
            always testing and exploring new ideas to make teaching and learning more engaging.

       <h6 id="challenges-and-goals">A new look for Aula</h6>
        <h3>A deep rebranding</h3>
        <p>In the Summer of 2021, I proposed and led the design of a new brand identity for Aula, centered around learning and 
            community. This brought a friendly, authentic, simple yet distinctive personality to Aula's visuals.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/aula/aula-branding.png" alt="The new Aula logo">
            <figcaption>A key visual featuring the new Aula logo and some illustrative elements.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There were many reasons for this change. The old brand identity was playful and helped us grow as a company. 
            However, as Aula evolved as a company, we outgrew it. A colour palette of mostly purple and teal limited the 
            combinations that would work visually while also being accessible. Accessibility and inclusion are extremely 
            important at Aula, so this had to be fixed. We appreciated the geometric simplicity of our old logo, but it 
            had poor legibility. The "A" in the old app icon was not easily recognisable. Finally, over time, different 
            illustration styles and uses of the logo made consistency an issue. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/aula/aula-old-branding.png" alt="Samples from the old Aula branding">
            <figcaption>The old Aula branding lacked a sense of cohesion.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Starting from the concepts of connection, collaboration, and engaging learning experiences, we worked to evolve 
            Aula's look and feel. The new identity is still friendly and simple but at the same time it feels recognisable 
            and mature.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/aula/aula-sample-layout.png" alt="A sample layout using the new Aula branding.">
            <figcaption>A sample layout using the new Aula branding.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The new logo evolves the geometric theme of the old one while also being distinctive and legible. The new 
            illustrations, created in collaboration with the talented illustrator <a href="https://www.francescofidani.com/" 
            target="blank">Francesco Fidani</a>, show a diverse learning 
            community exchanging ideas and knowledge in many different ways. The result is a visual branding that fully 
            expresses Aula's ways of being direct but respectful, optimistic but practical, conversational but not too 
            informal, and friendly but authentic.</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>The new Aula illustrations, created by Francesco Fidani, show a diverse learning community.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In addition to working on the visuals for the rebranding, I directly coordinated the launch of the new identity, 
            to make sure that the teams responsible for Aula's many touchpoints (e.g., apps, social media, help centre) 
            were updated at the same time. I also provided detailed branding guidelines, which was something that Aula 
            severely needed.</p>

        <h6 id="challenges-and-goals">Outcomes</h6>
        <h3>A measurable impact</h3>
        <p>My work has contributed to an increase of over 300% in the number of educators that are very satisfied with Aula. 
            When asked what they like about Aula, users consistently mention how the interface is attractive, modern and easy 
            to use. This improvement was instrumental in getting Aula to sign their first full-scale enterprise customers and 
            is having a measurable impact in allowing the company to expand to additional markets.</p>
