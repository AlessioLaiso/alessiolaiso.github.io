        <h3>Increasing user satisfaction and&nbsp;conversion</h3>
        <p>CarTrawler's technology is the world's leading solution connecting customers and travel companies to car hire and ground transportation options.
                CarTrawler works with over 100 airlines, including Ryanair, the largest airline in Europe. In 2017, a large part of CarTrawler's profits 
                came from Ryanair Car Hire. For this reason, it was crucial that we always innovated and refined our product, to increase user satisfaction,
                conversion and&nbsp;revenue.</p>

        <h3>Working closely with our clients</h3>
        <p>As the lead designer in CarTrawler's Strategic Business team, I took care of all the design efforts for the products of
                CarTrawler's most important partners, including Ryanair. I organised user research with the internal team of UX researchers, and worked closely
                with the Data Science team. I also worked directly with the Ryanair team, to make sure our designs integrated seamlessly and to recommend and 
                make the case for improvements to the platform.</p>

        <h6 id="process">Design process</h6>
        <h3>Leveraging qualitative and quantitative insights</h3>
        <p>Together with my team, I worked on the strategy and vision for Ryanair Car Hire, taking decisions informed by advanced analytics as well as 
            qualitative user feedback. We constantly and proactively presented ideas to Ryanair - and our other partners - to push the platform further. 
            I often ran user interviews and Design Thinking workshops, to collect ideas from our customer support agents and from the
            wider CarTrawler and Ryanair teams.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="p-between-img">Whenever an area of focus was identified, I started an iterative design process in which different versions of a screen or component
                were tested with real users to be validated and polished. Once we were happy with the new designs, we A/B test the new options against
                the current live version, and see the impact on revenue and conversion before deciding whether to roll out the new experience to the
                whole userbase.</p>

        <h6 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h6>
        <h3>An incredible growth</h3>
        <p>All our work gave Ryanair Car Hire an incredible growth, with an outstanding +43% between January 2017 and January
            2018. During this time frame, Ryanair Car Hire grew at 9.5 times the speed compared to the volumes of Ryanair flight passengers. Some of the 
            initiatives that made this possible include a complete redesign of the in-path booking flow, targeted emails throughout the user 
            journey, and countless smaller improvements across all touchpoints, all declined in 19 languages ranging 
            from English to Bulgarian and Chinese.</p>
